#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";

}

// Line 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
// Line 2: using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
// Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
// Line 5: cout (pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World".
